# MATLAB Simulink Transmitter Simulation

This project provides a **MATLAB Simulink-based transmitter simulation framework** designed for research on **Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF)**, including:

- RFF Modeling  
- RFF Concealment  
- RFF Spoofing and Physical Emulation  

It supports research and experiments on communication security, device identification, and physical-layer feature manipulation.
